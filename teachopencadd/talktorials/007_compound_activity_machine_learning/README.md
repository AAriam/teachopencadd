# Ligand-based screening: machine learning

## Aims of this talktorial

Due to larger available data sources, machine learning (ML) gained momentum in drug discovery and especially in ligand-based virtual screening. In this talktorial, we learn how to use different supervised ML algorithms to predict the activity of novel compounds against our target of interest (EGFR).

## Learning goals

* Different fingerprints to encode the molecules for usage in ML
* Different ML algorithms and their application
* Evaluation of ML model performance
