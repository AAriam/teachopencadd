    "    In this talktorial we will learn how to develop an <b>automated structure-based virtual screening pipeline</b>. This is particulary suited for the hit expansion and lead optimization phases of a drug discovery project, where a promising ligand (i.e. an initial hit or lead compound) needs to be structurally modified in order to improve its binding affinity and selectivity for the target protein. The general architecture of the pipeline can thus be summarized as follows (Figure 1):\n",

    "    Binding sites, also known as binding pockets, are cavities in the 3-dimensional structure of a protein in its natural state (Figure 3). These are mostly found on the molecular surface of the protein structure, and are the main regions through which the protein interacts with other entities. For a favorable interaction, the two binding partners need to have complementary steric and electronic properties (cf. lock-and-key principle, induced-fit model). Therefore, attractive intramolecular interactions between the residues of the binding pocket and, for example, a small molecule ligand is one of the key factors in determining the ligand's potency as a drug. A protein may possess several binding sites and interaction of a ligand with each of these binding sites may result in a different effects on the protein structure and thus affect its function. \n",

Ligands predicted to interact most favorably with a specific binding site of the protein can be designed that lead to a desired modulation of the protein's behavior, whether the goal is inhibition or stimulation of the protein's function. Conversely, it is also necessary to limit predictions to the binding site of interest so that calculated affinities correspond to binding of a given ligand to the desired pocket and not elsewhere on the protein structure. This is not a problem when a crystal structure of the target protein is available, where a ligand has usually been co-crystallized with the protein in the desired binding site. In that case, the residues surrounding the co-crystallized ligand can be simply used to define the binding pocket. However, when the available protein structure does not contain a co-crystallized ligand in the desired binding pocket, it is essential for the docking calculations to first detect and define a druggable pocket in the protein. \n",

This algorithm uses <b>geometry- and grid-based detection</b> where the protein is embedded into a Cartesian 3D-grid and each grid point is labeled as either free or occupied depending on whether it lies within the van-der-Waals radius of any protein atoms. Subsequently, an edge-detection algorithm used in image processing, called <b>Difference of Gaussians</b> (DoG), is used to identify protrusions on the protein surface. In doing so, cavities on the protein surface that can accommodate a spherical object are identified per grid point. Finally, cavities on neighboring grid-points are clustered together based on specific cut-off criteria, resulting in defined sub-pockets that are merged into pockets (Figure 4). \n",

    "    In this talktorial, we successfully implemented a <b>fully-automated virtual screening pipeline targeted at hit-expansion and lead-optimization phases of a drug discovery project</b>  using EGFR (PDB-code: 3W32) as the target protein and a promising inhibitor with the ChEMBL-ID CHEMBL328216. As the input, the pipeline accepted a single CSV data-file, specifying a protein structure (either as PDB-code or local PDB-file), a ligand (as one of the many possible identifiers, e.g. SMILES, CID, InChI etc.), and several other settings regarding the different processes of the pipeline. It then <b>performed all the necessary processes in order to derive at an optimized analog of the provided ligand in terms of binding affinity, number of protein-ligand interactions and drug-likeness</b>. \n",

    "    The process began with <b>binding-site definition</b> and binding-site detection using the <i>DoGSiteScorer</i> functionality of the <i>ProteinsPlus</i> webserver. The next step was a <b>ligand similarity-search</b> which is performed using the <i>PubChem</i> web-services via the provided API backend. Subsequently, the structural analogs detected via the similarity search were filtered based on their physiochemical properties in order to <b>select the most drug-like analogs</b>. These were assessed in a virtual screening process using the <i>Smina</i> program in order to <b>estimate their binding affinities and corresponding binding-poses</b>. Using the <i>PLIP</i> package, these generated docking poses were <b>analyzed in terms of their specific non-covalent interactions with the target protein</b> and analogs displaying a specific set of desired interactions were selected in order to achieve <b>higher selectivities for the target protein</b>. After all required processes were carried out, the pipeline was used to <b>output one or several optimized analogs</b>, based on the criteria defined by the user in the input data, such as binding affinity, physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, and specific interactions with the protein structure. The code is specifically structured in such a way that it will be easy to digest, maintain, and expand. For each functionality of the pipeline, several helper classes were defined containing static methods that are required to develop a certain part of the pipeline. These <b>static methods can be easily adopted for other projects</b>. \n",

Since the pipeline provides much more functionalities and options than what the scope of this talktorial allows to demonstrate, we have also provided a <i>Supplementary Information</i> section, which showcases the possibilities of the pipeline in more detail.

    "**Conceptual Questions:**\n",
    "1. Describe the processes involved in the hit-to-lead and lead optimization phases of a drug design pipeline. How are these processes implemented in the virtual pipeline described in this talktorial?\n",
    "2. Describe the important facets of binding-site definition in a general virtual screening pipeline. What options are available for binding-site definition and selection in this pipeline? \n",
    "#3. What are the possibilities for a virtual ligand-derivatization process? Which one is used in this pipeline? \n",
    "4. What chemical differences for obtained analogs might explain their lower calculated similarity than the threshold specified in the input data?\n",
    "5. Describe the criteria used in this pipeline to filter the initially obtained analogs for the docking calculation.\n",
    "6. What explains why we do not carry out the docking calculation for all initially obtained analogs?\n",
    "7. What were the preparation steps carried out for performing the docking calculations?\n",
    "#8. Why do we calculate protein-ligand interactions for each docking pose, although these interactions have been implicitly taken into account by the scoring function of the docking algorithm?\n",
    "9. What did the interaction analysis data tell us about selecting an analog with higher selectivity for the target protein?\n",
    "10. Why was it necessary to visualize the docked poses and their corresponding interactions? What are important criteria for ligand binding should we be looking for in these inspections?\n",
    "11. What criteria were used for selecting the best optimized ligand at the end of the pipeline? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises:**\n",
    "1. In order to prevent the talktorial from being too lengthy, we only demonstrated a sub-set of the options and information that the pipeline offers. By again using the ***LeadOptimizationPipeline*** instance, execute the pipeline and explore its other options by looking up the attributes and methods of different classes comprising the pipeline.   \n",
    "2. Try to implement a loop, where the final output of a pipeline is re-entered as the input for a new pipeline (i.e. try to optimize your initial input ligand through several runs, same as we did for the demonstration of the ***run_pipeline*** function). After how many cycles does the pipeline reach a plateau where no better analog can be found anymore?\n",
    "3. Generate your own input CSV-files  each time choosing a different set of specifications, and compare the results. Can you find a set of specifications that perform considerably better than the others?\n",
    "#4. Since this was a relatively large project and we have also offered many different options for each process of the pipeline, it may be the case that some options are not fully thought-out and developed. Try to run the pipeline with all possible combinations of specifications, and see if you can find a problem in any of the branches. "
