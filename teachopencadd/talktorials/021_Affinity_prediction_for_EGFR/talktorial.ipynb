    "\n",
    "In recent years, the use of neural networks in pharmaceutical research has shown promising results in addressing diverse problems in drug discovery. In this talktorial, we get familiar with the basic structure of artificial neural networks. We will learn how to build a simple two layer neural network and apply it to predict the pIC50 values of unknown compounds against EGFR, the target of interest. Furthermore, we will select three compounds from the query data set that are predicted to be the most active against the EGFR kinase."

However, the corresponding output will most likely be very different from the true value. In other words, the prediction error will be very poor: the loss function is far from being minimal. Therefore, the initial parameters have to be optimized to obtain better predictions.\n",

An efficient way to find such a minimum is to use the [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent#:~:text=Gradient%20descent%20is%20a%20first,the%20direction%20of%20steepest%20descent.) algorithm. This optimization scheme is iterative and uses both the derivative of the loss function (or gradient in the multi-variate case) and a learning rate. The main idea behind the algorithm is to follow the steepest direction of the function, obtained with the gradient and managing the length of each step through with learning rate. The latter is often referred to as a hyperparameter, which can be tuned using cross-validation (more details in future talktorials).\n",

    "\n",

Keras provides a way to create a model which is called [sequential](https://keras.io/api/models/sequential/). The layers are arranged sequentially where the data flows from one layer to another layer in the given order until the data finally reaches the output layer. Each layers in the ANN can be represented by a *keras layer*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compile the model** − The compilation is the final step in creating a model. Once the compilation is done, we can move on to the training phase. A **loss function** and an **optimizer** are required in the learning phase to define the prediction error and to minimize it, respectively. In the practical part of this talktorial, we use the mean squared error as a loss and the [adam](https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/) optimizer, which is a popular version of gradient descent and has shown to give good results in a wide range of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fit the model** - The actual learning process will be done in this phase using the training data set. We can call the [fit()](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#fit-method) method which needs several parameters such as **x**: input data, **y**: target data, batch size, epochs, etc. An _epoch_ is when the entire dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluate model** − We can evaluate the model by predicting the output for test data and cross-comparing the prediction with the true values of the test data by using the [evaluate()](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#evaluate-method) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Scatter plots are a common and simple approach to visualize the evaluation of a model. They plot the predicted vs. true values. If the fit was perfect, we should see the $y=x$ line, meaning that the predicted value is exactly the true value.\n",

    "1) **Sigmoid function (σ)**: It takes the form: $$\\boxed{f(x)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{−x}}}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  The sigmoid curve looks like a *S*-shaped curve as shown in the figure below. \n",
    "   - It has a \"smooth gradient\" which prevents jumps in the output values and it bounds the output values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "   - It is recommended to be used only on the output layer so that the output can be interpreted as probabilities. \n",
    "   - If you notice in the figure below, for $x$ values between -2.5 to 2.5, $y$ values are very steep, so any small change in values of $x$ in that region will cause value of $y$ to change significantly. It tends to bring the activations to either side of the curve.\n",
    "   - Another advantage of this activation function is that the output lies in range (0,1) compared to (-inf, inf) of linear function.\n",
    "   - But it has a major drawback, for very high or very low values of $x$, there is almost no change in y values or the prediction, causing a [**vanishing gradient**](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-vanishing-exploding-gradient-problem-in-deep-neural-networks-191358470c11) problem. This can cause the network to learn slowly or refuses to learn further. \n",

    "2) **Hyperbolic Tangent function or TanH**:  It takes the form: $$\\boxed{f(x)= tanh(x) = \\frac{2}{1+e^{-2x}}−1}$$ it looks very similar to the sigmoid function, it can also be written as $$\\boxed{tanh(x)= \\text{2 sigmoid (2x)}-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   - It has the same characteristics as a sigmoid function like being non-linear in nature and the output is bound between -1 and 1. But it has deeper [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative) which means it has stronger gradient than sigmoid as shown in the figure below. Deciding between sigmoid and tanh depends upon your requirement of gradient strength.\n",
    "   - The disadvantage that it shares with sigmoid function is that the it also has a vanishing gradient problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - This is the variation of ReLU which has a small positive slope in the negative area.\n",
    "   - The range of the Leaky ReLU is (-infinity to infinity).\n",

Depending on the type of problem you are trying to solve, you can choose an activation function which will approximate the function faster and lead to faster raining process.
