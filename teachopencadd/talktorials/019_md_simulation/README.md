# Molecular dynamics simulation

## Aims of this talktorial

In this talktorial, we will learn why molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are important for drug design and which steps are necessary to perform an MD simulation of a protein in complex with a ligand. The kinase EGFR will serve as sample system for simulation.
