GNNs are especially useful for representing structural data such as proteins and chemical molecules (ligands) to a deep learning model.

    "Protein-ligand interactions are of interest in research for many reasons as can be seen in [__Talktorial T016__](https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd/blob/master/teachopencadd/talktorials/T016_protein_ligand_interactions/talktorial.ipynb). One of the most important fields where being able to predict whether a certain pair of protein and ligand interact or not is the field of drug discovery. Classically, in drug development one want to find a new drug given a protein target. For example in the CoVid-19 pandemic, most pharmacy companies tried to find drugs to bind to the spike protein.

    "Our input is a dataset comprising a set of proteins and a set of ligands and a table with binding information for every pair of proteins and ligands. Speaking in terms of supervised learning (as in [__Talktorial T022__](https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd/blob/master/teachopencadd/talktorials/T022_ligand_based_screening_neural_networks/talktorial.ipynb)), our dataset we use for training, validation, and testing is the table of interaction data. One component of our network architecture is a simple Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN) as presented in [__Talktorial T022__](https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd/blob/master/teachopencadd/talktorials/T022_ligand_based_screening_neural_networks/talktorial.ipynb). The other two components are graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract features from the proteins and ligands in each pair of the dataset. As discussed in [__Talktorial T034__](https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd/blob/master/teachopencadd/talktorials/T034_link/talktorial.ipynb) GNNs are used to compute a representation of graph structured data that holds information about the structure. These representations are concatenated into one vector which serves as input for the final FNN.\n",

    "Here, I will focus on the conversion of proteins into graphs as the conversion of SMILES to graphs is explained in [__Talktorial T034__](https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd/blob/master/teachopencadd/talktorials/T022_ligand_based_screening_neural_networks/talktorial.ipynb).\n",

    "There are usually two ways to represent proteins in science. Either by their sequence of amino acids or as a PDB structure as introduced in [__Talktorial T008__](https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd/blob/master/teachopencadd/talktorials/T008_query_pdb/talktorial.ipynb). As amino acid sequences do not contain structural information, in protein ligand interaction prediction we use PDB files of proteins as input for our structure-based models. In the graph representation of a protein, every node of the graph represents an amino acid from the protein. Edges between nodes in the graph are drawn if the two represented amino acids are within a certain distance. This is the equivalent of an interaction between the two amino acids in teh protein. To compute the distance of two amino acids, we look at the coordinates of the $C_\\alpha$ atoms of the amino acids in the PDB file. If the distance between two $C_\\alpha$ atoms is below a certain distance threshold, we consider the amino acids to interact and insert an edge in the graph representation of the protein."

    "There is a whole zoo of GNN architectures proposed to solve many problems. If you want to get an overview over the most popular architectures, you can have a look at the [list of convolutional layers implemented in PyTorch-Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html#convolutional-layers). In this talktorial, we will use the GINConv layers as backbone of out GNNs as they have been proven to be powerful in embedding molecular data yet remaining easy to understand in their functionality. The formula to compute an embedding of a node based on the neighbors is\n",

The idea is to aggregate all neighbor embeddings together with the own current embedding and put this into a neural network to extract information on the nodes and it's neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen, GINConv layers do not use edge information in their computation. So, the only thing we need to extract from out proteins and ligands when turning into graphs are features for the edges. In this talktorial, we will use a very simple featurization and every node just contains categorical information on the amino acid type or atom type is represents. Information on onehot encodings of categorical data is covered in [__Talktorial T021__](https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd/blob/master/teachopencadd/talktorials/T022_one_hot_encoding/talktorial.ipynb).\n",

    "The final element to finalize our GNN module is the pooling function, that is used to compute the graph embedding based on the node embeddings in the final layer. For simplicity reasons (and because it's surprisingly powerful) we use mean pooling. That means, we just take the mean vector over all node embeddings in the final GINConv layer."
