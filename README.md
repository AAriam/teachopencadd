Open source programming packages for cheminformatics and structural bioinformatics are powerful tools to build modular, reproducible, and reusable pipelines for computer-aided drug design (CADD). While documentation for such tools is available, only few freely accessible examples teach underlying concepts focused on CADD applications, addressing especially users new to the field.

TeachOpenCADD is a teaching platform developed by students for students, which provides teaching material for central CADD topics. Since we cover both the theoretical as well as practical aspect of these topics, the platform addresses students and researchers with a biological/chemical as well as a computational background.

For each topic, an interactive Jupyter Notebook is offered, using open source packages such as the Python packages `rdkit`, `pypdb`, `biopandas`, `nglview`, and `mdanalysis`. Topics are continuously expanded and open for contributions from the community. Beyond their teaching purpose, the TeachOpenCADD material can serve as starting point for users‚Äô project-directed modifications and extensions.

## Get started

If you can't wait and just want to read through the materials, please go to the read-only version [here](https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/talktorials.html).

If you'd like to execute the provided notebooks, we offer two possibilities:

- üöß Online thanks to [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). This takes some minutes, but does not require any kind of setup on your end. Click here to get started: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/volkamerlab/TeachOpenCADD/master)
- Locally using our `conda` package. More details in this [section of the documentation](https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/installing.html).

If you prefer to work in the context of a graphical interface, talktorials T001-T008 are also available as [KNIME workflows](https://hub.knime.com/volkamerlab/space/TeachOpenCADD/TeachOpenCADD). Questions regarding this version should be addressed using the "Discussion section" available at [this post](https://forum.knime.com/t/teachopencadd-knime/17174). You might need to create a KNIME account.
