Installation
============
1. `Download <https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>`_ the latest version of Anaconda for Python 3.8.
2. Install Anaconda by following the instructions on the download page and/or in the executable.

If you are a more advanced user with Python already installed and prefer to manage your packages manually, you can just use `pip <https://jupyter.org/install>`_:

``pip3 install jupyter``

Running Jupyter
===============

On Windows, you can run Jupyter via the shortcut Anaconda adds to your start menu, which will open a new tab in your default web browser that should look something like the following screenshot.
